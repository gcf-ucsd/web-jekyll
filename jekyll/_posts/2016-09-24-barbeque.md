Join us for a BBQ gathering to kick off the new academic year! There'll
be food, games, and delightful conversation.

When: Saturday, September 24, 12:30-4:00pm

Location: Coast Apartments Community Room 9350 (9350 Redwood Dr., La
Jolla CA 92037). Free parking is available in the parking lots at the
coast apartments and along La Jolla Shores Dr. and Expedition Way.

What to bring: just yourself! However, do note that the coast apartments
are very close to the beach, so, if you'd like to drop down to the
beach, make sure you have what you need. Snacks or drinks to share are
welcome, but by no means required.
