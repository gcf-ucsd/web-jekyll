This week we'll be having a community dinner both to connect as a larger
community and to establish small groups for the coming academic year.
That means there are three reasons to attend:  free food, fellowship,
and casting your vote on the subject and timing of small groups!

(Of course, if you cannot make this event, but nevertheless wish to
attend a small group, you are more than welcome to do so:  email
gcf.ucsd@gmail.com at any time for such information.)

Details:

* *Date and time:* Thursday, October 5, 6:30pm - 8:30pm.
* *Location:* Contact gcf.ucsd@gmail.com for this information.
* *What to bring:* yourself and any ideas you might have about small
  groups!  Also, any food you would like to share is most welcome (but
  not required).

We hope to see you there!
