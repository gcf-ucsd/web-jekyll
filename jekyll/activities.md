At present, we engage in three regularly scheduled activities during
fall, winter, and spring quarters: [large group](#LargeGroup), [small
groups](#SmallGroups), and weekly [prayer meetings](#PrayerMeetings).
Each of these events shows up on the calendar on the 
[events]({{ "/events" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page.

## <a name="LargeGroup"></a>Large Group ##
Every other week while classes are in session, we convene as a whole
group for some time of fellowship and worship. Frequently large group
meetings feature a discussion of a topic pertinant to Christian
academics and intellectuals or a presentation by a speaker.

## <a name="SmallGroups"></a>Small Groups ##
On weeks during which there is no large group meeting, we split into
meetings of small groups. At present, there are three; their times and
places of meeting, as well as principal contacts, are given below:

* Mesa/OMS: 7:30pm Thursdays. Contact Rachel Hicks.
* On-campus: 7:30pm Thursdays. Contat Jason.
* Off-campus: 7:00pm Wednesdays. Contact Jeremy Kua.

## <a name="PrayerMeetings"></a>Prayer Meetings ##
Every week we spend an hour in prayer together.
