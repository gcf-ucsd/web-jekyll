Things to do (projects to work on):
* the activities page uses inline javascript to accomplish ROT13
  encryption of email addresses, primarily to lower spambot reading of
  the page. It would be nice to move this to external scripts so that
  editing the page is easier. (Alternatively, we could come up with
  another obfuscation technique.)
* Populate resources page more
* get rvm/jekyll running on acms account

vim: tw=72:ts=4
